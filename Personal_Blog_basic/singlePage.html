            <h2>Champions League Semi-Final, Real Madrid drew with Chelsea in their home match.</h2>
                <p>Champions League Semi-Final week has been started. In the first semi-final, the home team Real Madrid faced the English side- Chealse who has won the FA Cup just a week before. <br><br>
                It was a very competitive match as both teams are equally strong. Although Real Madrid is always the favourite when it comes to the Champions League. They played the most number of CL semi-finals. Besides, they have won the CL 13 times (Highest). But these are the stats only. <br><br>

                Chelsea started to attack from the very beginning. They started putting pressure on the home side. Real Madrid took a bit of time to cope up and handle the pressure. The match became interesting as both teams were playing a balanced football. But on the 14th minute, Christian Pulisic draws the first blood with his brilliant finish. Chelsea got their away goal and the lead. But they couldn't keep the lead for long. Karim Benzema scored at the 29th minute even with a better finish with a volley. The home team made a comeback and the score became 1-1. After that, the match became a balanced one as both teams were equally attacking and holding the possession. The half time ends with 1-1 at the scoreline. Though it could be 1-2 if Timo Werner could score when he got the chance at 4 yards from the goal line.<br><br>
                However, the rest of the match went in the same balanced way. Both teams were creating chances but nobody could create a major threat in the opposition's D-box. As a result, the match ended with a 1-1 draw. N'Golo Kanté was the man of the match as he showed an extraordinary performance today to stop Real Madrid from scoring. <br><br>

                Though Chelsea will have the advantage as they have scored an away goal today. They just have to defend in the second leg when Real Madrid will visit them in the Stamford Bridge on the 6th of May. It will be a very much interesting one as both the team has equal chances to play the final and they will give their best for it.

            <h2>Manchester City won the EFL Cup for 4 consecutive years beating Tottenham by 1-0</h2>
                <p>Manchester City has beaten Tottenham hotspur by 1-0 in the final of League Cup 20/21. Man city becomes the champion for 4 consecutive years. They have played a total of 9 finals in this competition and won 8 of them.<br><br>

                Tottenham also reached the final 9 times. But they have won only 4 of them. 
                
                Man city is in great form this season under pep Guardiola. They are at the top of the Premier League table. A few days back, they have lost Against Chelsea in the FA Cup final, so they were more hyped to win this competition. On the other hand, Tottenham started the Premier League well, but slowly they slipped down in the point table. So, it was a chance for them to prove themselves.<br><br>
                
                However, the match was an exciting one though man city was the clear favourite in the final. Tottenham fought well, but man city kept attacking from the beginning and kept putting pressure on the opposition side. Man City was building up attacks one after one but failed to find the back of the net every time. As a result, the score was 0-0 after half time. <br><br>
                
                Fans were hoping that Son, Bale, Kane will come back strongly in the second half, but man city didn't give them a chance. Rather, they were building more pressure on the opposition. Spurs defended the whole match pretty well. But Man City finally scores the only goal of the match in the 82nd minute. When all the attackers were failing to score, the defender Aymeric Laporte came to the rescue for the blues. He scored a header from Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick and brought the lead for his team.<br><br>
                
                Though Tottenham found one or two chances to score, they couldn't really use it. Man city becomes the champion as the game ended 1-0.<br><br>
                
                It was really heartbreaking for the Tottenham players and the fans. They were so close to the title yet so far. After the match, Son Heung Min broke into tears.<br><br>
                They fought hard for the title and were 1 step away from it. But they couldn't stand in front of Pep Guardiola's tactics. Guardiola won his 9th title with man city including this one. And it will be 10 if they win the premier league title, which is pretty much sure they will as they are leading the table by 10 points from the 2nd position with 5 matches left.</p><br>
